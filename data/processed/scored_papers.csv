Missile guidance with assisted deep reinforcement learning for head-on interception of maneuvering target,"W Li, Y Zhu, D Zhao","In missile guidance, pursuit performance is seriously degraded due to the uncertainty and randomness in target maneuverability, detection delay, and environmental noise. In many methods, accurately estimating the acceleration of the target or the time-to-go is needed to intercept the maneuvering target, which is hard in an environment with uncertainty. In this paper, we propose an assisted deep reinforcement learning (ARL) algorithm to optimize the neural network-based missile guidance controller for head-on interception.

A Learning-Based Computational Impact Time Guidance,"Zichao Liu, Jiang Wang, Shaoming He, Hyo-Sang Shin, Antonios Tsourdos",This paper investigates the problem of impact-time-control and proposes a learning-based computational guidance algorithm to solve this problem. The proposed guidance algorithm is developed based on a general prediction-correction concept: the exact time-to-go under proportional navigation guidance with realistic aerodynamic characteristics is estimated by a deep neural network and a biased command to nullify the impact time error is developed by utilizing the emerging reinforcement learning techniques. The deep neural network is augmented into the reinforcement learning block to resolve the issue of sparse reward that has been observed in typical reinforcement learning formulation.

Deep Reinforcement Learning‐Based Air Defense Decision‐Making Using Potential Games,"Minrui Zhao, Gang Wang, Qiang Fu, Xiangke Guo, Tengda Li","This study addresses the challenge of intelligent decision‐making for command‐and‐control systems in air defense combat operations. Current autonomous decision‐making systems suffer from limited rationality and insufficient intelligence during operation processes. Recent studies have proposed methods based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address these issues. However, DRL methods typically face challenges related to weak interpretability, lack of convergence guarantees, and high‐computing power requirements. To address these issues, a novel technique for large‐scale air defense decision‐making by combining a DRL technique with game theory is discussed. The proposed method transforms the target assignment problem into a potential game that provides theoretical guarantees for Nash equilibrium (NE) from a distributed perspective. The air‐defense decision problem is decomposed into separate target selection and target assignment problems. A DRL method is used to solve the target selection problem, while the target assignment problem is translated into a target assignment optimization game. This game is proven to be an exact potential game with theoretical convergence guarantees for an NE. Having simulated the proposed decision‐making method using a digital battlefield environment, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated.",2023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e6292cfceb81eb526e24fcc3157b5c582a0e61b3,Advanced Intelligent Systems,semantic_scholar,,,8,1,5,2,"Novel combination of DRL with potential game theory for air defense decision-making, providing theoretical convergence guarantees for Nash equilibrium in distributed target assignment problems","Limited to simulation environment, no mention of computational complexity analysis, lacks discussion of real-time performance requirements or hardware constraints",False,other,"High relevance as it addresses multi-agent air defense coordination using DRL, but remains purely theoretical with simulation-only validation.
